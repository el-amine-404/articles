# Contributing

Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues to improve the language of those articles.

## Reporting issues

It's important to use a proper title when opening new issues. The title must be in the format `article name: simple description of the problem.`

You should also check the [issues](https://github.com/el-amine-404/articles/issues) for the latest discussions involving the current and future versions of the articles.

**Issues that don't follow this format will be closed.**


## Creating Pull Requests

If you're new to contributing to projects hosted on Github, or need a refresher, you may find [How to make your first pull request on GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/) a useful resource.

It's important to use a proper title in the commit messages and pull requests. The title must be in the format `article name: simple description, what the commit/pull request does`.

One Pull Request - One Article. This avoids the risk of having to revert changes to multiple articles if any problem is subsequently found with the PR. It also means that reviewing your changes is more straightforward.

**Pull Requests that don't follow this format will be closed.**
