# Articles

Welcome to my Articles Repository!


This repository hosts technical articles originally written by me. It is **open to contributions** from anyone willing to improve or update the content in a spirit of collaboration and support for the community.

Each article is written in Markdown format for simplicity, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

## Why This Repository?

While the internet is full of technical articles, many of them suffer from the same problems:
- They quickly become **outdated**.

Publishing platforms like **Medium** or **Dev.to** often **lack a native API**, forcing writers to manually copy and paste content multiple times ‚Äî a tedious and error-prone process. As a result, writers rarely revisit and update their articles; if they do, they often have to publish a completely new version (e.g., "Version 2").

This repository was created because:
- I believe in the **power of the open-source community**.
- I want to **give back** to the community that taught me the most.
- I aim to **share my writing workflows** to help others easily create, update, and manage technical content.

My Workflow:
- Articles are written using **Markdown** for simplicity and long-term maintainability.
- I plan to use **[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)** to generate a **website** based on templates, making articles easily accessible and beautifully presented *(Pandoc can also be used to generate PDFs and many other formats)*.
